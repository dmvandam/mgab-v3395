# MGAB - V3395

MGAB - V3395 is an interesting system discovered by Gabriel Murawski (MGAB) that shows deep asymmetric eclipses (primary and secondary) with an orbital period of approximately 227 days.
Another interesting feature is that the primary and secondary eclipse are not separated by 0.5 (in phase space), suggesting that the system is on an eccentric orbit.

Data has been collected by ASAS-SN, ZTF, HOYS and several amateurs (Sjoerd Dufoer, Tonny Vanmunster) and the Astrolab IRIS team.

Asymmetric eclipses could be the result of tilted and inclined circumstellar disks, which, due to projection effects, produce an elliptical occulter.

This repository takes a look at the data and explores what kind of orbits are possible to produce these eclipses.
